## Git Issues
I created a respository and added a readme file. Then I created a local repo and created html files. When I tried to push my code to github it hit me with fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories. This was because the remote and local repo had no shared history. So i did git merge origin/main --allow-unrelated-histories to merge everything. I could have rebased but it's only a readme file. Then I was able to push my code into my remote repo. 

I don't know why I created a master branch, maybe during the commit process, i was not able to push so i created a seperate branch. I will delete the branch, eventually.
